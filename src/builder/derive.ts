 *    the `{roleTypeId, count}` list for N roles (DEC-ROLE-1), never assuming a
 *    captain/mate pair. This is the graduation of the N-role sketch that lived in
 *    `brewboat.test.ts`.
 *  - `deriveShiftState` computes the Shift's crewing state from its seats
 *    (DEC-005: shift state is derived, never set directly; required seats gate
 *    `Crewed`, supernumeraries don't).

 *
 * ⚠️ KNOWN GAP (revisit at 1.4b/M3): `AtRisk`-from-`Bailed` is **horizon-blind**.
 * SPEC §1.1 distinguishes an *early* bail (time to refill → back to `Filling`)
 * from a *late* bail (no time/pool → `AtRisk`); a clockless deriver can't tell
 * them apart, so every bail reads as a crisis here. The bail/horizon split (and
 * whether `Bailed` is a transient flag the ask loop clears) lands with the ask
 * loop + staffing horizon — worth an @architect pass before then.
